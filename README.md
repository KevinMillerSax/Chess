# The Game of Chess

## About the Game
My Chess app allows two players to enjoy this classic board game. Tiles receive a green border when a player selects a piece, which can only be moved to a square indicated by validation algorithms.  If a player wants to select a new piece, he/she simply clicks the formerly selected piece to toggle it off before choosing a new piece.  All special moves are valid such as castling, the en passant, and the pawn promotion.  When it's the next player's turn, the button next to their name will turn red. Captured pieces will appear next to the board.
